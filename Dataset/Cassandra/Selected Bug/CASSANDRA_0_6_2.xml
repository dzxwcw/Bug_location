      <summary>start script occasionally causes flapping when used with runit</summary>
      <description>Starting cassandra in the foreground is the preferred way of running it under something like runit or daemontools. Currently, the start script will execute java in a subprocess when starting in the foreground. This is a problem for runit and daemontools since they both register the pid of start script. Occasionally the start script process will fail, leaving the java process running. The runit supervisor will then start flapping since it thinks cassandra is down even though there is a java process running.The attached patch will run cassandra in the same process as the start script when run in the foreground. This will cause runit and daemontools to have the correct behavior.</description>
