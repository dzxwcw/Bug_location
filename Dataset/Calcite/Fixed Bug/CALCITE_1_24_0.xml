      <summary>Mock table &amp;#39;EMPNULLABLES&amp;#39; should allow nulls in all non-pk columns</summary>
      <description>Currently Mock table 'EMPNULLABLES' allows nulls in almost every column. It does not allow nulls in the primary key which is expected and the column 'ENAME' that is unexpected.I realized that 'ENAME' column was declared as not nullable after debugging for quite some time a test where I was wrongly assuming that all columns of the table were nullable. To avoid this kind of confusion in the future I propose to make 'ENAME' also nullable. The impact on existing tests is minimal.</description>
