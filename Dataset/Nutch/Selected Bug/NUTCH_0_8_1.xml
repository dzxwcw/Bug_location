      <summary>Improve description of thread related configuration for Fetcher</summary>
      <description>For some time I've been puzzled by the interaction between two paramters that control how often the fetcher can access a particular host:1) The server delay, which comes back from the remote server during our processing of the robots.txt file, and which can be limited by fetcher.max.crawl.delay.2) The fetcher.threads.per.host value, particularly when this is greater than the default of 1.According to my (limited) understanding of the code in HttpBase.java:Suppose that fetcher.threads.per.host is 2, and that (by chance) the fetcher ends up keeping either 1 or 2 fetcher threads pointing at a particular host continuously. In other words, it never tries to point 3 at the host, and it always points a second thread at the host before the first thread finishes accessing it. Since HttpBase.unblockAddr never gets called with (((Integer)THREADS_PER_HOST_COUNT.get(host)).intValue() == 1), it never puts System.currentTimeMillis() + crawlDelay into BLOCKED_ADDR_TO_TIME for the host. Thus, the server delay will never be used at all. The fetcher will be continuously retrieving pages from the host, often with 2 fetchers accessing the host simultaneously.Suppose instead that the fetcher finally does allow the last thread to complete before it gets around to pointing another thread at the target host. When the last fetcher thread calls HttpBase.unblockAddr, it will now put System.currentTimeMillis() + crawlDelay into BLOCKED_ADDR_TO_TIME for the host. This, in turn, will prevent any threads from accessing this host until the delay is complete, even though zero threads are currently accessing the host.I see this behavior as inconsistent. More importantly, the current implementation certainly doesn't seem to answer my original question about appropriate definitions for what appear to be conflicting parameters. In a nutshell, how could we possibly honor the server delay if we allow more than one fetcher thread to simultaneously access the host?It would be one thing if whenever (fetcher.threads.per.host &gt; 1), this trumped the server delay, causing the latter to be ignored completely. That is certainly not the case in the current implementation, as it will wait for server delay whenever the number of threads accessing a given host drops to zero.</description>

      <summary>unavailable robots.txt kills fetch</summary>
      <description>I think there is another robots.txt-related problem which is notadressed by NUTCH-344,but also results in an aborted fetch.I am sure that in my last fetch all 17 fetcher threads diedwhile they were waiting for a robots.txt-file to be delivered by a notproperly responding web server.I looked at the squid access log, which is used by all fetch threads.It ends with many HTTP-504-errors ("gateway timeout") caused by acertain robots.txt url:&lt;....&gt;1166652253.332 899427 127.0.0.1 TCP_MISS/504 1450 GEThttp://gso.gbv.de/robots.txt - DIRECT/193.174.240.8 text/html1166652343.350 899664 127.0.0.1 TCP_MISS/504 1450 GEThttp://gso.gbv.de/robots.txt - DIRECT/193.174.240.8 text/html1166652353.560 899871 127.0.0.1 TCP_MISS/504 1450 GEThttp://gso.gbv.de/robots.txt - DIRECT/193.174.240.8 text/htmlThese entries mean that it takes 15 minutes before the request endswith a timeout.This can be calculated from the squid log, the first column is therequest time (in UTC seconds), the second column is the duration ofthe request (in ms):900000/1000/60=15 minutes.As far as I understand it, every time a fetch thread tries to get thisrobots.txt-file the thread busy waits for the duration of the request(15 minutes).If this is right, then all 17 fetcher threads were caught in this trapat the time when fetching was aborted, as there are 17 requests inthe squid log which did not timeout before the message "aborting with17 threads" was written to the nutch-logfile.Setting fetcher.max.crawl.delay can not help here.I see 296 access attempts in total concerning this robots.txt-url inthe squid log of this crawl, but fetcher.max.crawl.delay is set to 30.</description>

      <summary>Proper (?) handling of URIs in TagSoup.</summary>
      <description>Doug Cook reported that TagSoup incorrectly handles some URI parameters. More discussion on the list and at TagSoup's mailing list.http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/tagsoup-friends/message/838I looked at the sources of TagSoup because I'm using it myself (although the URIs are not relevant for me). It seems like you can implement a naive workaround by remembering the parsing state and just avoiding entity resolution. Attached is the patch that does this.</description>
